# horiseon

**Introduction**
Marketing Agency Horiseon was seeking a junior developer-in-training to ensure web accessibility and promote their online prescence. This project required refactoring of an existing code to meet accessibility standards and promote their website in major search engines such as Google. Web accessibility is critical, more than ever before, in this day and age. We must ensure we do everything in our power to ensure access to information in the real and virtual world. To help make their website more accessible, well that's where I come into the picture!

**Project Details**
This assignment utilized agile project management methods. I was provided with the following (as per https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/762/assignments/16667?module_item_id=275928):

User Story
    AS A marketing agency
    I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
    SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Acceptance Criteria
    GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
    WHEN I view the source code
    THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    WHEN I view the image elements
    THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    WHEN I view the heading attributes
    THEN they fall in sequential order
    WHEN I view the title element
    THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

This project required the use of Terminal (via Git Bash) to input commands,  Visual Studio Code to create html and css files. GitHub was used to create a new Repository under the name "Horiseon", where all progress and updates were saved, and ultimately publish the live URL (https://rpanglia.github.io/horiseon/).
